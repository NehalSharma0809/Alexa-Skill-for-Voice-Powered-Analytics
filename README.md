# Alexa-Skill-for-Voice-Powered-Analytics

Introduction
This Alexa skill queries metrics from a data lake. The aim of building this skill is to understand how to uncover Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from a data set, build and automate queries for measuring those KPIs, and access them via Alexa voice-enabled devices.
